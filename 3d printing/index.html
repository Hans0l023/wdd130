                <h2>Customized lightsabers aren't so far away. All you have to do is put in a request. These will be 3d printed and to your liking. It could be one that already exist, or one that you want to design yourself.
                    They are not exspensive, sadly though they have no light in them nor a blade. It is just the Hilt. The make great props for you Jedi or Sith cosplay.
